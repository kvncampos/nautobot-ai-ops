Added `mcp_nautobot_query` tool to MCP server for simplified Nautobot API queries with automatic endpoint discovery, eliminating the need for agents to manually chain schema discovery and API request tools.

Enhanced system prompt with explicit tool workflow instructions requiring agents to use discovery tools before making API requests, preventing guessed URL 404 errors.

Improved `mcp_nautobot_dynamic_api_request` to return helpful guidance on 404 errors instead of raising exceptions, allowing agents to self-correct.
