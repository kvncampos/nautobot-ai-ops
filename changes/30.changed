Enhanced chat widget markdown rendering with comprehensive CSS styling for tables, code blocks, lists, blockquotes, and all markdown elements. Added intelligent query handling to request clarification for ambiguous identifiers (e.g., "DFW-ATO" could be device/site/circuit) before searching. Improved system prompt with explicit filtering examples for specific items and detailed markdown formatting requirements including proper table syntax with separator rows and blank lines between elements. Added MCP server logging to warn when GET requests are made without filter parameters for debugging LLM behavior.
